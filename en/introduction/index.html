        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In a small temple in Namba, Osaka, one hundred <em>ōgi</em> enthusiasts gather for an extraordinary evening. They will participate in the <em>hyakumonogatari kaidankai</em> – an old Japanese tradition where each person tells a strange story before extinguishing their candle.</p>
        
        <p>Ninety-nine flames form a circle in the great hall. At the center burns the hundredth, protected by a blue lantern. This is where the Association President sits, keeper of the final story.</p>
        
        <p>When all the lights go out, legend says, something extraordinary will happen.</p>
        
        <p>The participants aren't professional storytellers. They're people like you and me: students, office workers, shopkeepers, retirees... United by their passion for <em>ōgi</em>, this modern strategy game that brings them together each week.</p>
        
        <p>Tonight, they'll share their personal experiences. No ghosts in kimonos or mythical monsters – just disturbing events that occurred in Osaka's familiar streets, in the buildings where we live, the shops where we do our errands. Strange things that happen when we least expect them.</p>
        
        <p>The candles are lit. Silence falls.</p>
        
        <p>The first story is about to begin.</p>
