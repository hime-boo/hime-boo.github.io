        <h2>Chapter 88 : The Enlightened One</h2>
        <p><em>Narrator : Takeru - District : Namba</em></p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>The organizer furrows his brows as he checks his list.</p>
            <p>“I don’t see… Ah, Takeru-san, were you registered?”</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p>A man stepped out of the shadows. His clothes were dirty and torn, his hair matted. A sharp odor reached us. Several participants instinctively backed away.</p>
        
        <p>“I’m a former trader,” he began in a hoarse voice. His eyes gleamed in the temple’s dim light. “I thought I could win it all. Day after day I watched those red and green candles dance across my screens. They rose, they fell, hypnotizing me, burning my eyes and my mind.”</p>
        
        <p>“I was blinded by gain and lost myself in the darkness.”</p>
        
        <p>“But one day, the third light appeared to me.”</p>
        
        <p><em>He turned toward the blue lantern at the center of the hall, his features softening as if he were entering a trance.</em></p>
        
        <p>“That specter-lamp revealed the truth. It freed me from all that madness and brought me serenity. Perfect stillness.”</p>
        
        <p><em>He smiled with unsettling bliss, his gaze fixed on the blue flame.</em></p>
        
        <p>“I play in its light.”</p>
        
        <p><em>He blew out the eighty-eighth candle and slipped back into the shadows the way he had come.</em></p>
